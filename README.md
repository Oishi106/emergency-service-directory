## About the Project

Emergency Service Directory is a web platform designed to help users quickly find and access essential emergency services (e.g., hospitals, fire stations, police, ambulance) in their area. The directory offers a simple, intuitive interface that lists detailed contact information, locations, and service types, enabling users to connect with the right help during critical situations.
